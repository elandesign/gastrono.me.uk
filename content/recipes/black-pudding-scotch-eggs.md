What better way to begin a kitchen diary than with a complete experiment? No recipe to follow, just a memory of a fantastic starter shared with a good friend at [Whitelock's Ale House](http://www.whitelocksleeds.com/) in Leeds and a desire to recreate it.

The egg was soft boiled in the middle, allowing the yolk to ooze out and mix with the creamy black pudding and crispy breadcrumb shell. Throw in some tangy brown sauce and a few crisp salad leaves for a deliciously tasty version of the picnic treat.

To try to achieve the runny centres, the eggs were dropped into a pan of cold water, brought to the boil and removed from the heat. Stopwatch on hand, these were left in the hot water for 5 minutes before removing and plunging into cold water to stop them cooking.

At this point it would have been best if the eggs used were not totally fresh as it makes them easier to peel - a fiddly job when the centres are still soft and the risk of squishing them is high. Mine had been bought a week earlier, and would probably have worked better had they been closer to their use-by date. The first egg split when peeling, which was less than ideal, but allowed me to check the inside. The sloppy white and uncooked yolk looked okay to me, as the cooking would be completed in the deep fryer.

The casing was made by blending the black pudding with some sausage meat in a food processor until it became a paste. This was then divided into four equal portions, each of which was flattened between two pieces of greaseproof paper with a rolling pin to about the size and shape of a chicken breast fillet. 

Each egg was dredged in seasoned flour, and the meat was shaped around it. Into the fridge to firm up for 20 minutes, then back through the flour, egg and breadcrumbs before deep frying. The end result - not bad:

The egg could have been a little firmer (maybe another minute in the hot water), but the yolk was warmed through and the coating was tasty with a satisfying crunch to the shell.

Ingredients
-----------

Makes 4 scotch eggs

- 4 eggs (preferably close to their use-by date)
- 200g black pudding
- 80g sausage meat
- 30g flour
- 2 beaten eggs
- 100g breadcrumbs
- Salt & pepper

Method
------

Place the eggs in a pan of cold water, and bring to the boil. As soon as the water is boiling, remove from the heat and leave to stand for 6 minutes, then remove the eggs and plunge into a bowl of cold water. Leave them to cool before peeling them carefully.

Meanwhile blend the black pudding and sausage meat in a food processor until it forms a smooth paste. Divide the meat into 4 equal portions, and roll each one out between 2 pieces of greaseproof paper until it is big enough to wrap an egg. 

Roll the meat around the egg and smooth over the ends. Place the meat coated eggs in the fridge for 30 minutes to allow the coating to firm up.

Roll each egg through flour seasoned with salt and pepper, then through the beaten egg, then through breadcrumbs. Back through the egg and breadcrumbs for second coating before deep frying at 180ÂºC for 12 minutes.
