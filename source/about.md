About gastrono.me.uk
====================

My name is Paul. I like food.

Everyone likes food, right?

I _really_ like food. When I'm not eating I'm often planning what I'm going to cook next, or where I'm going to eat, or making plans to have people over so I can cook for them. It's partly a social thing, the act of sharing something good with people you care about, but it's also about taking some time to do something I enjoy.

gastrono.me.uk is a domain I bought because it was a vaguely clever domain hack, with the intention of doing something foody with it. Ta-da...

This site was originally hosted on Posterous, but within weeks of me finally getting round to posting something Twitter inevitably decided to drop the guillotine on it. Bloody typical.

After a bit of hacking, I've put this together using [Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com), which seems to be working quite well so far. It's a bit of a work in progress, so please excuse the mess. If this was 1997 then there would be some humorous "men at work" animated gifs plastered everywhere, but it's not, so there aren't.

If you want to contact me, [@elandesign](http://twitter.com/elandesign) is your best bet.
