This is simple vegetable curry, roughly based on [a similar recipe](http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/96608/sweet-potato-spinach-and-lentil-dahl) that I found online.

As I had a bag of frozen spinach[^1] taking up space in the freezer I thought I'd give that a go, and I chose my own spices (and forgot the turmeric, but it works well enough without it).

Also, this gave me a good excuse to have a go at making homemade [chapattis](/recipes/2013/03/11/chapattis.html), which I always prefer to naan bread, and are ridiculously quick and easy to make.

Serves 4

Ingredients
-----------

- Vegetable Oil
- 2 Medium Onions, diced
- 4 Cloves of Garlic, finely chopped
- 4 Teaspoons Minced Ginger
- 1 Teaspoon Minced Red Chilli
- 1 Teaspoon Garam Marsala
- 1 Teaspoon Curry Powder
- 5 Tomatoes, roughly chopped
- 3 handfuls red lentils
- 800 ml Vegetable Stock
- 3 Sweet Potatoes, roughly chopped
- 1 Green Chilli, finely sliced
- 5 Briquettes Frozen Spinach
- Coriander

Method
------

Sweat the onion, ginger, garlic and chilli in the oil for a few minutes until translucent, then add the garam marsala and curry powder and cook for a couple of minutes more.

Add the tomatoes and allow to soften, before adding the lentils and covering with stock.

Allow to simmer gently for 10 minutes, then add the sweet potatoes and cook through.

Add the finely sliced chilli and spinach and simmer for a minute or two more, stir through the coriander and serve.

[^1]: Don't bother. It seemed like a good idea when I bought it, but it's rubbish as a vegetable. Works quite well here as an ingredient, but when cooked by itself it's soggy and insipid.
