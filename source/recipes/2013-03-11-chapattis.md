When I decided to make a [curry](/recipes/2013/03/11/sweet-potato-lentil-and-spinach-curry.html) my instinct was to make naan breads, but flicking through my cookbooks I found this recipe for chapattis in [The Fabulous Baker Brothers'](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Fabulous-Baker-Brothers-Tom-Herbert/dp/0755363655) book.

The recipe given really is as minimal as this[^1], so I guess it helps if you're used to making bread as you tend to get a feel for the consistency you're looking for.

I'm assuming regular wholemeal flour is what the recipe recommended, but as I only had strong flour available I used that, and the result was pretty good - close in texture and flavour to restauraunt bought chapattis, if a little less circular - more practice needed.

Ingredients
-----------

- Wholemeal flour
- Salt
- Water

Method
------

Put the flour and salt into a food processor with a dough attachment, and add the water until a soft dough is formed. 

Leave the dough to develop for 20 minutes while you make your curry

Divide the dough into balls, each one a bit bigger than a golf ball.

Roll into thin rounds, and cook for a few minutes on each side in a dry, non-stick, frying pan which is as hot as you can get it.

[^1]: For those who like numbers in their recipes, the suggested quantities provided as an aside are 250g wholemeal flour, 1/2 tsp salt, and 170 ml water.
