I'm not sure if this counts as rye bread being a mixture of white and rye flours, but it's simple, tasty.

Useful Equipment
----------------

**Scrapers** are really good for manhandling the dough and separating it from your bench. I got a couple of [these](http://bakerybits.co.uk/Flexible-Dough-Scraper-P388392.aspx) - well worth it for a couple of quid.

**Proving Baskets** allow your dough to rise, hopefully without sticking to the sides so that they turn out easily. Before I bought mine I experimented with an oiled or floured mixing bowl, sometimes lined with a clean teatowel. The quantities below give two 750g loaves, which when proved in [these baskets](http://bakerybits.co.uk/750g-15lb-Oval-Cane-Banneton-P688499.aspx) just to say fit side-by-side in my oven.

You *could* buy a **baking stone** to make sure the bottom of your loaves get a good crust. A quick search on Google shows plenty of choice, with a decent sized bit of rock setting you back Â£30-35. Alternatively a granite chopping board can be had for about a tenner, and baking is probably the best use for it - anyone who uses a glass or stone chopping board for its intended purpose will end up with blunt knives very quickly. Just make sure you scrape any plastic feet off it first.

Ingredients
-----------

For the sponge

* 200g Rye Flour
* 250g Strong White Flour
* 600ml Water
* A slug (25ml) of vegetable oil
* 2 level tsp Yeast

For the loaves

* 450g Strong White Flour
* 15g Salt
* Flour and semolina for dusting

Method
------

Mix all the sponge ingredients together well, until you have a thick batter. If you're not using instant yeast you'll need to dissolve it in your water before adding to the mix.

Cover your sponge mixture and leave overnight to ferment. I usually leave mine for about 20 hours, mixing it up last thing at night then finishing it off when I get back from work the next day.

Once the mixture has fermented, add the rest of the flour and the salt and mix well. Turn out onto your bench and give it a good knead - it's quite a wet dough, but it'll come together in the end.

Return the dough to your (clean) mixing bowl and leave to prove for an hour or two until doubled in size.

The dough now needs 'knocking back' - deflating. Split into two equal portions, shape, and place into your well floured proving baskets. Leave for another 45 minutes to an hour until the dough has risen again.

Coat your peel or baking sheet with enough semolina and flour to prevent the loaves from sticking. Turn the loaves out and slide onto your baking stone.

Bake for 25 minutes at 200&degrees;C, then lower the temperature to 180&degrees;C for the last 10 minutes. Allow to cool on a rack before eating if you have the willpower.
